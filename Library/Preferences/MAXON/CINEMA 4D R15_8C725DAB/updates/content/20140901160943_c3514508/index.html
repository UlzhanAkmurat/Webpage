  <p class="p1"><b>This is the service update 15.064 for CINEMA 4D and BodyPaint 3D R15.<br />
  This update is highly recommended for all R15 users as it contains many improvements and fixes.</b></p>


  <p class="p3"><b>Important Note for Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) Users</b></p>
  <p style="margin-top:5pt"><b>Apple has activated the energy saving mode by default for OS X 10.9. This can result in updates not being completed if they are very large or if you have a slow internet connection. We recommend temporarily disabling App Nap in the Finder while CINEMA 4D is updating.</b></p>
  <p><b>With this service pack, MAXON is providing an immediate update to its Online Updater in response to Apple's modification, which means that App Nap does not have to be disabled manually for future CINEMA 4D updates.</b></p>
